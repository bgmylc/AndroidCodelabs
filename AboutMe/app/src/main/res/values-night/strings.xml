    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Begum.
\n \nI love cats.
\n \nThe kind that is alive and runs around.
\nFun fact is that I have several cats.
\nAnd sometimes I even go to vet.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually help a cat.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to look after your own cat.
\nYou should ask someone else about being veterinarian, though.
        \n \nI also like dogs
\nBut I am allergic to dogs.
\nSo, I should get an allergy shot to own a dog.\n I would like to have a Husky or a Golden Retriever.</string>
